## Inspiration
The inspiration for "Avada Kedavra," the hand-controlled wizard game, stemmed from a desire to create an immersive and interactive gaming experience. Drawing inspiration from popular wizardry themes in fantasy literature and films, such as the Harry Potter series, we aimed to bring the magic to life through a unique and hands-on gameplay experience.

## What it does
"Avada Kedavra" is a wizard game that allows players to cast spells using hand gestures. Utilizing hand-tracking technology, players can control their player to kill their enemies. But be careful... more enemies spawn faster the more you progress!

## How we built it
Our project is built using Unity as a game engine and C# as the main programming language. The hand-tracking is based on an open source project built in python that has been forked and modified to fit our needs.

## Challenges we ran into
- Learning Unity
- Connecting the running python script to the rest of the game to make sure hand gestures work as intended.
- Layering our objects proeprly and ensuring there is good collision detection.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Completeting the full game with some more advanced features than initially planned.
- Working together and dividing the work amongst everyone.
- Learning enough unity within the day to actually complete the project.

## What we learned
- Unity
- Working together in a quick enviornment 
- Connecting the hand-tracking tech to the actual game

## What's next for Avada Kedavra
Demo time!
